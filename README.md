# Shopify Embedded App Frontend Framework

## Overview

It's a framework built and updated by <a href="http://www.microapps.com" target="_blank">microapps</a> based on the layout of Shopify merchant admin, as well as its embedded applications, in order to help the developers to easily and quickly write the application's frontend so that it has the same look and feel as Shopify merchant admin.

All the elements and structures were conceived to be used in an Shopify embedded application

## Files found in the project

This project includes the files that should be included in your embedded projects, as well the documentation of these files. What is important to know is the following:
* **seaff.css**: the css file that does all the magic - and that therefore should be included in embedded projects
* **docs.html**: the main documentation file, with explanations about embedded apps and how to use the framework as well as examples of use
* **full-width-table.html**: a single example of one element - since it is better visualized alone in a page
* **index.html**: a file that organizes the documentation files and imitates Shopify Merchant Admin interface
* **snippets-generator.js**: used to generate snippets more easily - you shouldn't use this file for anything, unless you think it will be useful for your project
